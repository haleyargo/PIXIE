      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>A habit app that assists users with creating a daily habit of creating and practicing art.</p>
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Aspiring artists often find themselves falling into ruts and not being able to find inspiration, often scouring the internet to try to find different generators and moodboards that spark some interest. From personal experience, I can attest that this constant searching can be discouraging and impact oneâ€™s motivation to continue creating.</p>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>PIXIE combines generators, moodboards, and goal points to allow the user to not only find daily inspiration in one source, but also motivate themselves to continue creating.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="target-user">
      <h1>persona</h1>
      <p>The target user of this app is generally young artists and online creators. The audience is familiar with technology and social media such as pinterest and instagram. They are greatly influenced by other artists and find their inspiration on the internet.</p>

      <h1>Process</h1>
      <div class="research">
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>I mostly looked at habit apps posted on Dribble and Behance. I also took a lot of inspiration form Instagram as a photo sharing and viewing platform. <br>What I took away from this research was that in general, user interaction and understanding is the most important part of the design.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="interviews">
        <h2>User Interviews</h2>
        <p>I made sure to have the user give me as much feedback as they could imagine. I had the user go through each step of my prototype, telling what they felt and thought about the UX and UI design. The user did not struggle with the onboarding of the app, but the activity pages and Inspiration generator were confusing points for them. This lead to me redesigning these pages until we both felt it was satisfactory.</p>

      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>My main challenge in this project was staying consistent with the layout and design components. There was an overwhelming amount of pages I needed to make, so I felt most overwhelmed with ensuring that these were cohesive.</p>
      <h2>Successes</h2>
      <p>I am most proud of the overall branding of this project. I feel that I envoked the exact vibe I was looking for througn colors, fonts and graphics. I also loved the way the Inspiration Station section ended up looking, especially since I did not feel confident about how it would look. Overall, I am proud of my execution of this project.</p>
